#Interview Questions

1.	What does the current system do?

-	Multiple excel spreadsheets that list all the AV equipment

2.	What are the problems or drawbacks of the current system?

-	There is no notification system
-	Data is easily out of date.

3.	How much data is currently recorded?

-	Current data stored is the item name, its location, the quantity and it’s value.

4.	What extra data will need to be included?

-	PAT testing’s
-	Current location
-	The item’s usable state (working, in need of repair, being repaired etc)

5.	How frequently will the data need to be updated?

-	The data will need to be updated a few times a month or so
-	Whenever the location changes 

6.	Will new records need to be added or deleted? If so, how often?

-	New records will need to be entered, or some deleted every couple of months.
-	Whenever new equipment is bought or if an item is sold

7.	How important is the data or information that is to be recorded?

-	Data is of high importance as it will be kept as a record for insurance in case of theft or damage

8.	Are there any algorithms that are going to need to be implemented?

-	The number of a single item there is at a particular location
-	The total number of that item altogether
-	The sum of the values those individual items (value per unit * quantity)

9.	When are the algorithms going to be run?

-	These will need to be run when there are new items added/removed to a group of the same item
-	If the value of an item changes

10.	What inputs are required for the proposed system?

-	Inputs are likely to be text, numbers and currency
11.	What outputs are required for the proposed system?

-	Outputs are likely to be the same as the inputs
-	Notifications of when PAT tests are in need or reissue
-	Notifications when an items location or quantity is changed
-	A print function would be necessary

12.	Are hard copies required?

-	Yes, hard copies would be required a visual backup.

13.	Are back dated records required?

-	Yes, for insurance purposes

14.	How long are these records going to be kept?

-	We will keep back dated records for a year

15.	How are these records going to be stored?

- We will store them electronically on the file server

16.	How often will outputs be required?

-	Outputs will be required whenever possible

17.	What computing resources do you currently possess to aid the new system’s operation?

-	We currently have a Mac Pro that we use as a file server. This is where the database system will be placed.

18.	Is security an issue?

-	No, security is not an issue, although the data would need to be backed up.

19.	Should there be restricted access to certain areas?

-	No, restricted access is not needed.

20.	What errors and exceptions will need to be reported in the new system?

-	I’m not 100% until we start testing the system.

21.	How should these errors and exceptions be reported?

-	Errors should be reported to you either via email or another notification method.

22.	Are there any constraints on hardware, software, data, cost or time?

-	No budget, time deadline is flexible and we'll adapt to whatever software/hardware resource available.
